# ROBOTICS-PROJECT-SEM05 ü§ñüöÄ

## Introduction
This project, serves as our  Robotics semester project for the 5th semester of BS Artificial Intelligence at Bahria University. The project focuses on creating a wall-following robot controller using the Webots simulation environment. The robot will navigate along a wall while avoiding obstacles.

## Program
üìò This project is part of the BS Artificial Intelligence program at Bahria University.

## University
üè´ Bahria University

## Instructor
üéì Professor Adil Khan

## Implementation Details

### Robot Configuration
ü§ñ - The robot consists of two wheels: a left wheel and a right wheel.
- Eight proximity sensors (ps0 to ps7) detect obstacles around the robot.

### Controller Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - Set the time step for simulation.
   - Define the maximum speed for the robot.

2. **Motor Configuration:**
   - Enable the left and right motors.
   - Set the initial motor positions and velocities.

3. **Sensor Setup:**
   - Enable the proximity sensors.
   - Read sensor values during each simulation step.

4. **Main Loop:**
   - While the simulation is running:
     - Read sensor data from all eight proximity sensors.
     - Determine if there's a wall on the left, a corner on the left, or an obstacle in front.
     - Adjust the left and right motor speeds accordingly:
       - If there's a front wall, turn right in place.
       - If there's a left wall, drive forward.
       - If there's a left corner, steer right to avoid collision.

5. **Actuator Commands:**
   - Set the left and right motor velocities based on the calculated speeds.

6. **Exit Cleanup:**
   - Perform any necessary cleanup before exiting the simulation.
